### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

<!--
**marjeanm/marjeanm** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:
-->
ðŸŒ± Currently Learning: Advancing my skills in cybersecurity with a focus on network security, threat detection, and incident response. Currently exploring MongoDB for secure data management, while enhancing my expertise in Node.js for secure web application development and building secure, scalable systems.
ðŸš€ Projects in Progress: Working on securing networks using IDS/IPS solutions, developing security protocols for web applications, and contributing to a cybersecurity blog where I share insights on securing IT infrastructures and cloud environments.
ðŸ’¬ Ask Me About: Cybersecurity best practices, network defense, secure coding, cloud security, and my experiences with security tools like Splunk, Snort, and Juniper Networks.
âš¡ Fun Fact: When Iâ€™m not improving my security skills, Iâ€™m diving into Marvelâ€™s universe or exploring the immersive worlds of Bethesda and Microsoft Studios
