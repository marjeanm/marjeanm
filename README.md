# 👋 Hi, I'm Marjean Mayo-Baker

**Security Engineer | GRC Strategist | Chaos Tamer**

Welcome to my GitHub — the vault where I break down real-world security failures, build Zero Trust from the ground up, and document every step like it’s forensic evidence. I specialize in governance, risk, and compliance (GRC), and I'm passionate about making policies **work in the wild** — not just on paper.

## 🔐 What I Do
- Architect MFA and Identity controls using Microsoft Entra ID
- Design simulations and Forge-style training modules for Security Engineering roles
- Map real-world failures to frameworks (NIST, SOX, MITRE, etc.)
- Document internal governance like a threat actor is watching
- Package it all up in clean Markdown and PDFs you can actually use

## 🚨 Projects in Progress
- `MFA_Governance_SIM`: A complete MFA rollout simulation — policy, pilot, testing, issues, cleanup, and governance docs
- `Ghost_MFA_Token_Analysis`: Forensic case on stale authenticator entries, ghost devices, and remediation
- `SOX_Control_Reference`: Map security actions to SOX audit points for enterprise reporting
- `NullCypher`: My custom generative AI assistant designed for GRC, neurodivergent support, and threat modeling

## 📎 Live Like a Checklist
- MFA should never lock out your admins.
- Policies should be **enforceable**, **auditable**, and **adaptable**.
- Every issue deserves a writeup. Even the ghosts.
