# 🛡️ Marjean Mayo-Baker – Cybersecurity Engineer | Builder of Systems, Not Just Scripts

I’m a Cybersecurity Engineer building real-world solutions at the intersection of system defense, automation, and ethical AI.

With 14+ years in IT and a current pivot into cybersecurity, I’ve already:

Deployed hardened Linux systems with custom PKI

Written Bash scripts to automate provisioning and backups

Built a generative AI assistant (NullCypher) that supports neurodivergent analysts like me

Delivered layered IDS/IPS strategies using Splunk, Snort, and Microsoft Defender

Worked hands-on with Zscaler, VMware Horizon, Security Onion, and Entra ID

I don’t just study cybersecurity — I live it, break it, document it, and rebuild smarter. My projects reflect the work I actually do, not what a title gave me permission to do.
### 🔧 Current Projects
- `NullCypher`: Generative AI assistant built for neurodivergent cybersecurity workflows
- `secure-host-hardening-and-pki`: End-to-end OpenSSL-based PKI setup with hardened Linux deployments
- `bash-system-provisioning`: Admin automation & redundant backup scripting
- `network_security`: IDS/IPS strategy and defense-in-depth report for a multi-store retail chain

### 🧠 Specialties
- Security automation (Bash, PowerShell)
- Identity & access management
- Log analysis & incident response
- Ethical AI & system usability for overlooked brains

### 🧰 Tools
Security Onion · Zscaler · Splunk · OpenSSL · Entra ID · Git · Wireshark · Notion · GitHub Pages

##  ⚠️ Site-Wide Disclaimer: GitHub Under Construction
Welcome to my GitHub.
It’s not broken — it’s actively being rebuilt from the inside out.

This entire space is mid-refactor, mid-renaming, mid-cleaning, and mid-identity shift. You may see:

💥 Half-baked scripts with zero context

🔁 Duplicate or legacy repos waiting to be archived

🧠 Notes that make sense only to me (for now)

⚠️ Projects in active mutation with unfinished docs, missing screenshots, and chaotic commit logs

I'm not hiding the mess — because this is what building looks like when you’re actually doing the work, not just demoing the results.

If you're here to lurk, recruit, or learn: welcome.
If you're here to judge based on polish instead of power: wrong repo.

This is real dev energy in a neurodivergent system. Come back when it’s clean — or stick around and watch it evolve.
