# 🛡️ Marjean Mayo-Baker – Cybersecurity Engineer | Builder of Systems, Not Just Scripts

I’m a Cybersecurity Engineer building real-world solutions at the intersection of system defense, automation, and ethical AI.

With 14+ years in IT and a current pivot into cybersecurity, I’ve already:

Deployed hardened Linux systems with custom PKI

Written Bash scripts to automate provisioning and backups

Built a generative AI assistant (NullCypher) that supports neurodivergent analysts like me

Delivered layered IDS/IPS strategies using Splunk, Snort, and Microsoft Defender

Worked hands-on with Zscaler, VMware Horizon, Security Onion, and Entra ID

I don’t just study cybersecurity — I live it, break it, document it, and rebuild smarter. My projects reflect the work I actually do, not what a title gave me permission to do.
### 🔧 Current Projects
- `NullCypher`: Generative AI assistant built for neurodivergent cybersecurity workflows
- `secure-host-hardening-and-pki`: End-to-end OpenSSL-based PKI setup with hardened Linux deployments
- `bash-system-provisioning`: Admin automation & redundant backup scripting
- `network_security`: IDS/IPS strategy and defense-in-depth report for a multi-store retail chain

### 🧠 Specialties
- Security automation (Bash, PowerShell)
- Identity & access management
- Log analysis & incident response
- Ethical AI & system usability for overlooked brains

### 🧰 Tools
Security Onion · Zscaler · Splunk · OpenSSL · Entra ID · Git · Wireshark · Notion · GitHub Pages
